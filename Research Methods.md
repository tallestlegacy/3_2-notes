## Introduction to Research Methods

Research is a systematic and methodological approach hto creating knowledge.  
It structures the way we get knowledge, so we have more certainty about the result.  
Research methods are rules for getting the knowledge; rules that are clear ti others so they can be assessed and judged.

### Sources of Knowledge other than research

1. Knowledge from everyday experiences
2. Examples of exclusions from everyday life.
3. Generalizing from experience with one person to a group of people.

### Quality of a good research

1. **Systematic** -

## Research Process & Hypothesis

### Research Methods vs Methodology

**Research methods** may be understood as all those methods techniques that are use for conduction of research.
Research Methods or techniques thus refer to the methods the researcher uses in performing research operations.

**Research methodology** is a way to _systematically solve the research problem_. It may be understood as the science of studying how research is done scientifically.

### Approaches of Research

1. **Quantitative research** is base in the measurement of quantity or amount. It is applicable to phenomena that can be expressed in terms of quantity.
2. **Quantitative research** on the other hand, is concerned with qualitative phenomena i.e phenomena relating or involving quality or kind. For instance, when we are interested in investigating the reasons for human behaviour.
3. **Inferential approach** - The purpose of the inferential approach to research is to form a data base from which to infer characteristics or relationships of population.
4. **Experimental Approach** to a project involves several items, including the facility used, the model itself, the test conditions where the model is tested, and corrections that are applied to the data.
5. **Simulation Approach** - A Simulation refers to the imitation of real world activities and processes in a safe environment. It has an advantage of allowing learners to _reset_ the learning environment.

**Research process** contains a series of closely related activities which has to carry out by a researcher. The Research process requires patience.

There is no measure that shows your research is the best. It is an art rather than a science. The following are the main steps in social or business research process.

#### Steps in Research process

1. Selection of <u>Research Problem</u>
2. Extensive Literature <u>Survey</u>
3. Making Hypothesis
4. Preparing the Research Design
5. Sampling
6. Data Collection
7. Data Analysis
8. Hypothesis testing
9. Generalization and Interpretation
10. Preparation of Report

##### 1. Selection of Research Problem

The selection of topic fo research is a difficult job. When we select a title or research statement, then other activities would be easy to perform.  
The research topic or problem should be practical, relatively important, feasible, ethically and politically acceptable.

##### 2. Literature review or Extensive Literature Survey

After the selection of research problem , the second step is that of literature mostly connected with topics. The Availability of the literature may bring ease in the research. For this purpose academic journals, conference and government reports and library may be studied.

##### 3. Making Hypothesis

The Hypothesis is a tentative solution of a problem;

$$
Hypo + thesis = Hypothesis
$$

The development of hypothesis is a technical work depends on the research experience. The hypothesis is to draw the positive & negative cause and effect aspects of a problem. Hypothesis narrows down the area of a research and keep a researcher on the right path.

##### 4. Sampling

The researcher must design a sample. It is a plan for raking its respondents from a specific area or universe. The sampling may be of two types :

- probability sampling
- non-probability sampling

##### 5. Data Collection

Data collection is the most important work to a researcher. The collection of information must be containing facts which from the following types of researchers.

**Primary Data Collection** : Primary data may be from the following

- Experiment
- Questionnaire
- Observation
- Interview

**Secondary Data Collection** : it has the following categories :
it includes any printed media.

##### 6. Data Analysis

When data is collected, it is forwarded for analysis which is the most technical job. Data analysis may be divided into main categories.

##### 7. Data Processing

It is sub-divided into the following

- Data editing
- Data classification
- Data tabulation
- Data presentation
- Data measurement
- Description
- Explanation
- Narration
- Conclusion/Finding
- Recommendations

##### 8. Hypothesis Testing

Research data is then forwarded to test the hypothesis. Is the hypothesis related to the facts or not? To find the answer the process of testing hypothesis is undertaken which may result in accepting or rejecting the hypothesis.

##### 9. Generalisation and Interpretation

The acceptable hypothesis is possible for researcher to arrival at the process of generalisation or to make a theory/ Some types of research has no hypothesis for which researcher depends upon a theory which is known as interpretation.

##### 10. Preparation of Report

A researcher should prepare a report for which he has done is his work. He must keep in his mind the following points

- **Report design in Primary Stages**  
  The report should carry a title, brief introduction of the problem and background followed by acknowledgement. There should be a table of contents, graphs and charts.
- **Main text of the report**  
  It should contain objectives, hypothesis, explanations and methodology of the research. It must be divided into chapters and every chapter explains separate title in which summary of the findings should be enlisted. The last section should be conclusions to show the main theme of the Research study.

##### Closing the Report

After the preparation of report, the last step in business research process contains bibliography, references, appendices, index and maps or charts for illustration. For this purpose the information should be clear.

### Theoretical vs Conceptual Framework

The **theoretical framework** is a structure that summarises concepts and theories, which you develop from previously tested and published knowledge which you synthesize to help you have a theoretical background, or basis for your data analysis and interpretation of the meaning contained in your research data.

The **conceptual framework** comprises your thoughts on identification of the research topic, the problem to be investigated, the questions to be asked, the literature to be reviewed, the theories to be applied, the methodology you will use, the methods, procedures and instruments, the data analysis and interpretation of findings, recommendations and conclusions you will make.

### Variables in Research

- **The Independent Variable** - the independent variable which is a stimulus variable or _input_ operates either within a person or within environment to affect his behaviour.
- **The Dependent variable** - the dependent variable is response variable or _output_. It is an observed aspect of the behaviour o an organism that has been stimulated. The dependent variable is that factor which is observed and measured to determine the effect of the independent variables.
- **The Moderator Variable** - the term moderator variable describes a special type of independent variable a secondary independent variable selected for study to determine if it affects the relationship between the primary independent variable and the dependent variable.

### Hypothesis

The Hypothesis is a tentative solution of a problem;

$$
Hypo + thesis = Hypothesis
$$

_Hypo_ means a tentative or subject to verification and _Thesis_ means statement about solution of a problem.

#### Steps in testing a Hypothesis

1. Formulate a Hypothesis
2. Collect data
3. Analyze data to test the hypothesis
4. Draw conclusion

#### Nature of a hypothesis

1. It is **Conceptual** in nature. Some kind of conceptual elements in the framework are involved in a hypothesis.
2. It is a **verbal statement in a declarative form**. It is a verbal expression of ideas and concepts, it is not merely idea but in the verbal form, the idea is ready enough for empirical verification.
3. It has the **empirical referent**. A hypothesis contains some empirical referent. It indicates the tentative relationship between two or more variable.
4. It is a **forward or future reference**, A hypothesis is future oriented. It relates to the future verification not the past facts and informations.
5. It is the **pivot of a scientific research**. All the research activities are designed for verification.

#### Functions of Hypothesis

1. It is a temporary solution of a problem concerning with some truth which enables an investigator to start his research work.
2. It offers a basis in establishing the specifics wt to study for and may provide possible solutions to the problem.
3. Each hypothesis may lead to the formulation of another hypothesis.
4. A preliminary hypothesis may take the shape of final hypothesis.
5. Each hypothesis provides the investigator with the definite statement which may be objectively tested and accepted or rejected and leads for interpreting results and drawing conclusions that is related to original purpose.

#### Types of Hypothesis

_What is the relationship between advertising expenditure and income_  
A hypothesis dealing with the same question is

- There is positive relationship between advertising expenditure and income. (H<sub>1</sub>)
- There is NO relationship between advertising expenditure and income (H<sub>0</sub>)

## Sampling

- Learn the reasons of sampling
- Develop an understanding about the different sampling methods
- Distinguish probability & non-probability sampling
- Discuss the relative advantages and limitations of different sampling methods

> A **sample** is "a smaller (but hopefully representative) collection of units from a population used to determine truths about said populations" (Field 2005)

1. Why Sample?

- Resources (time, money) and workload
- Gives result with known accuracy that can be calculated mathematically

The **sampling frame** is a list from which the potential respondents are drawn

- Registrar's office
- Class rosters
- Must assess sampling frame errors

What is the population of interest?

- To whom do you want to generalize your results?
  - All Doctors
  - School children
  - Women ages 15-45 years etc.

Can you sample the entire population?

3 factors that influence sample representative-ness

- Sampling procedure
- Sample size
- Participation (response)

When might you sample the entire population?

- When your population is very small
- When you have extensive resources
- When you don't expect a very high response

The sampling process comprises several stages

1. Defining the population of concern
2. Specifying a _sampling frame_, a _set_ of items or events possible to measure
3. Specifying a _sampling method_ for selecting items or events from the frame
4. Determining the sample size
5. Implementing the sampling plan
6. Sampling and data collecting
7. Reviewing the sampling process

### Population Definition

A population can be defined as including all people or items with the characteristic/features one wishes to understand
Because there is very rarely enough time or money to gather information from everyone or everything in a population, the goal becomes finding the representative sample or subset of that ...

### Sampling Frame

_sampling_ frame which has the property that we can identify every single element and include in our sample.

- The sampling frame must be representative of the population.

### Probability Sampling

A **probability sampling** scheme is one in which every unit in the population has a chance (greater than zero) of being selected in the sample, and this probability can be accurately determined.

When every element in the population does have the same probability of selection, this is known as _equal probability of selection_ EPS design. Such design are also referred as _self-weighting_ because all the sampled units are given the same weight.
