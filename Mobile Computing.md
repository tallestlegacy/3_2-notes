# Mobile Computing

> This is a course that will study wireless technology

This is computing or transmission of data without having fixture to a physical means : _computing over physical mobility_.

**User Mobility** - grant user to move from one place to another
**Device Portability** - the device has to be portable.

**Disadvantages of Device Portability**

1. Can be stolen
2. They need charge
3. Physical damage
4. Limited functionality

**Disadvantages of User Mobility**

1. Network issues

##### Characteristics of a mobile computing environment

1. **User Mobility**  
   The user must be allowed to move from one place to another and still be able to compute transmitted and received data wirelessly

2. **Network Mobility**  
   You are allowed to jump from one network to another

3. **Device Mobility**

4. **Bearer Mobility** - the end service that we can access 

5. **Service Mobility**  
   
6. **Session Mobility**
